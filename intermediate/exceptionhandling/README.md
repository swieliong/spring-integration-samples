    localhost:8080/employee3 EmployeeServiceException is thrown. Response code is sent as 500.

Letâ€™s consider a few HTTP Methods:
 * GET : Should not update anything. Should be idempotent (same result in multiple calls).
 * 		Return Codes 200 (OK) + 404 (NOT FOUND) + 400 (BAD REQUEST)
 * POST : Should create new resource. Ideally return JSON with link to newly created resource.
 * 		Return code 201 (CREATED) can be used.
 * PUT : Update a known resource. ex: update client details.
 * 		Return Codes : 200(OK) + 404 (NOT FOUND) + 400 (BAD REQUEST)
 * DELETE : Used to delete a resource.
 * 		Return Codes : 200(OK).
